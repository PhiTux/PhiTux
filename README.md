### Hi there 👋

🛠 I love to build Web-Apps and tools for the web, since I'm regularly working with all 3 OSs Linux, Windows and Mac (➡ works on all of them) and since the data is then in sync automatically. So you will rarely catch me developing a *normal* programm 😉

👨‍🎓➡👨‍🏫 I studied physics and computer science at the university of Konstanz and now I'm a teacher for those subjects at a german [Gymnasium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(Germany))

💻 Hardly using Linux as desktop-OS at the moment (since the german school system is very dependent on Windows 🙄), but did so for several years during university and will probably use and love Linux forever as a server-OS 😍
