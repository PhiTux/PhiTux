### Hi there 👋

🛠 I love to build Web-Apps and tools for the web, since I'm regularly working with all 3 OSs Linux, Windows and Mac (➡ works on all of them) and since the data is then in sync automatically. So you will rarely catch me developing a *traditional* desktop program 😉

👨‍🎓➡👨‍🏫 I studied physics and computer science at the university of Konstanz and now I'm a teacher for those subjects at the [Karl-Maybach-Gymnasium (KMG)](https://www.kmg-fn.de/).

💻 Hardly using Linux as desktop-OS at the moment (since the german school system is very dependent on Windows 🙄), but did so for several years during university and will probably use and love Linux forever as a server-OS 😍

I've experience with:
- Linux Server Administration 🐧
- Docker 🐋 (using **and** creating docker-images)
- Web Frontend (based on Frameworks like [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and formerly [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/))
- Web Backend ([Python FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [Go](go.dev))

I love to compete at the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in December. I typically use Java for the challenge to keep my skills sharp, as it’s the language I teach in school.
